# Email Downloader

This is a quick Python utility for searching and downloading emails from Gmail (or any
email provider made available via IMAP).

I needed a means to automatically download emails using more strict search features
than typically provided. While the utility could be repurposed for more general use,
I specifically needed it to gather digital receipts sent to my email inbox.

This utility is part of a larger effort to build a Budget + Register application, which

I started with this article + snippet, and then quickly moved onto an example using `imap_tools`.
